# Varun Singh
I'm a software engineer, with an MS in Computer Science from UC San Diego.  
My technical interests include large-scale distributed systems, backend programming, and machine learning. I've been very interested in LLMs lately, specifically when it comes to reasoning, creativity, and architecture. I've also got a growing interest in machine learning infra.
I enjoy dabbling in many different programming-related things. My hobbies include music production and photography. Opinions are my own.
